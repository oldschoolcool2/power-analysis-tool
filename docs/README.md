## üìñ About the Documentation Framework

This project's developer documentation follows the **[Diataxis documentation framework](https://diataxis.fr/)**, a systematic approach to technical documentation that organizes content into four distinct types:

1. **Tutorials** (learning-oriented) - Practical lessons that teach skills
2. **How-to Guides** (task-oriented) - Directions for specific tasks
3. **Reference** (information-oriented) - Complete technical specifications
4. **Explanation** (understanding-oriented) - Context and design rationale

This structure ensures developers can quickly find the right information for their current need, whether they're learning, working on specific tasks, looking up details, or seeking deeper understanding.

## üîÑ Documentation Maintenance

### When to Update Documentation

**Main README.md (root):**
- Adding/changing user-facing features
- Updating installation/deployment instructions
- Changing statistical methods or analysis types

**CLAUDE.md:**
- Adding new architectural patterns
- Changing helper functions or core logic
- Adding dependencies
- Modifying development workflow

**CONTRIBUTING.md:**
- Changing contribution process
- Updating code style guidelines
- Adding new testing requirements

### Documentation Workflow

1. **During development:** Update relevant docs in the same PR as code changes
2. **For new features:** Update Main README + CLAUDE.md + create report in reports/enhancements/
3. **For refactoring:** Create report in reports/quality/
4. **For documentation itself:** Update this index (docs/README.md) if structure changes

---

## üìù Documentation Standards

- **Format:** Markdown (.md) for all documentation except legacy .txt files
- **Style:** Clear, concise, with code examples
- **Structure:** Follow Diataxis principles (see CLAUDE.md)
- **Links:** Use relative links within documentation
- **Code blocks:** Always specify language (```r, ```bash, etc.)
- **Tone:** Professional but approachable

---

## üÜò Need Help?

- **User questions:** See [Main README](../README.md)
- **Development questions:** See [CLAUDE.md](development/CLAUDE.md)
- **Contributing questions:** See [CONTRIBUTING.md](development/CONTRIBUTING.md)
- **Can't find something:** Check this index or search within docs/
