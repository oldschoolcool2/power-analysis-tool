## Research Findings Summary

### 1. Revolutionary Propensity Score Methods (January 2025)

**Source:** Li, F., Morgan, K.L., Zaslavsky, A.M. (2025). "Sample size and power calculations for causal inference of observational studies." arXiv 2501.11181.

**Key Insights:**
- **Paradigm shift:** Traditional variance inflation factor (VIF) methods are often "vastly inaccurate"
- **New approach:** Power calculations require only 2 additional parameters beyond RCT inputs:
  1. Strength of confounder-treatment association
  2. Strength of confounder-outcome association
- **Bhattacharyya coefficient:** Proposed as measure of covariate overlap
- **Propensity score distribution:** Can be uniquely determined from treatment proportion and overlap measure

**Implications for Our Tool:**
- Current roadmap VIF calculator (Tier 1, Feature 4) is based on Austin (2021) methods
- Need to **update** to incorporate 2025 methods OR provide both approaches
- Should include Bhattacharyya coefficient calculator
- Add educational content explaining limitations of VIF methods

**Action:** Expand Tier 1 Feature 4 to include both Austin (2021) and Li et al. (2025) methods

---

### 2. Clustered Data and Design Effects

**Sources:** Multiple meta-analyses (2024) on ICC values by outcome type

**Key Insights:**
- Design Effect formula: DE = 1 + (m - 1) × ICC
  - Where m = cluster size, ICC = intraclass correlation
- **Typical ICC values by domain:**
  - Behavioral outcomes: 0.01-0.05
  - Clinical outcomes: 0.01-0.10
  - Process measures: 0.10-0.30
  - GP practice-level: 0.017 (meta-analysis average)
- Ignoring clustering leads to Type I error inflation

**Real-World Impact:**
- Example: 100 patients from 4 GP practices (m=25, ICC=0.017)
  - Effective sample size = 71 (29% reduction)
- **Critical for RWE:** EHR/claims data are inherently clustered

**Validation:** Current roadmap Tier 2 Feature 9 (Design Effect Calculator) is well-justified

---

### 3. Minimal Detectable Effect Size - Critical for RWE

**Sources:** 2024 NBER working paper on observational studies; 3ie working paper

**Key Insights:**
- In **secondary data use**, sample size is FIXED by available database
- Power calculations are "backwards" - need to determine what effects are detectable
- Should show:
  - Minimum detectable RR, OR, HR for binary/survival
  - Minimum detectable Cohen's d for continuous
  - Power curves across range of effect sizes
  - Feasibility assessment ("Can detect small/medium/large effects")

**Quote from research:**
> "Sample size is often predetermined by available database in observational studies. The key question is: what effects can we reliably detect with this N?"

**Validation:** Current roadmap Tier 1 Feature 3 (Minimal Detectable Effect) is **essential**

**Enhancement:** Should be available for ALL analysis types, not just a few

**Current Roadmap Status:**
- Mentioned for rare disease (Tier 7, Feature 17) but not as standalone feature

**Recommendation:** Add as **Tier 3 feature** for rare disease context (Priority: ⭐⭐⭐)

---

### 8. Time-to-Event Equivalence/Non-Inferiority Enhancements

**Sources:** 2023 paper on non-proportional hazards; 2025 paper on RMST

**Key Insights:**
- **Current limitation:** Cox PH assumes proportional hazards
- **Problem:** Non-proportional hazards are common, causing power loss
- **Solutions:**
  - **Restricted Mean Survival Time (RMST):** More robust, increasing use
  - **Direct survival function comparison:** Works under non-proportional hazards
  - **Multiple time-point tests:** Weighted tests across time

**Relevant R packages:**
- `powerMediation` - survival equivalence
- Online calculators available

**Current Tool Status:**
- Survival analysis: Cox PH only (Tab 5, 6)
- Non-inferiority: Binary outcomes only (Tab 10)
- **Gap:** No time-to-event non-inferiority or equivalence

**Recommendation:** Add time-to-event equivalence/NI as enhancement to existing tabs

---

### **Optional Enhancements to Propensity Score Calculator**

The current implementation provides a solid foundation for propensity score sample size calculations. The following enhancements would further strengthen the tool's capabilities and user experience. These are **optional add-ons** that can be implemented incrementally based on user feedback and priorities.

#### **Enhancement 1: Interactive Sensitivity Visualization**

**Priority:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ **SHOULD HAVE**

**Vision:**
Transform static recommendations into interactive exploration tools that help researchers understand the sensitivity of their sample size estimates to key assumptions.

**What:**
- **2D heat map** showing sample size requirements across ranges of φ (overlap) and R² (confounding)
- **Interactive sliders** allowing real-time parameter adjustment
- **Color-coded regions** indicating feasibility (green = achievable, yellow = challenging, red = may not be feasible)
- **Comparison overlay** showing Austin vs. Li estimates side-by-side

**Implementation Approach:**
```r
# Using plotly for interactive visualization
create_ps_sensitivity_heatmap <- function(n_rct, treatment_prev, weight_type) {
  # Generate grid of φ and R² values
  phi_seq <- seq(0.3, 1.0, by = 0.05)
  rho_seq <- seq(0.0, 0.4, by = 0.02)

  # Calculate N for each combination
  grid <- expand.grid(phi = phi_seq, rho = rho_seq)
  grid$n_required <- mapply(calculate_n_li_2025,
                            overlap_phi = grid$phi,
                            rho_squared = grid$rho,
                            MoreArgs = list(n_rct = n_rct, ...))

  # Create interactive plotly heatmap
  plot_ly(data = grid, x = ~phi, y = ~rho, z = ~n_required,
          type = "heatmap",
          colorscale = "Viridis") %>%
    layout(title = "Sample Size Sensitivity to Overlap and Confounding",
           xaxis = list(title = "Overlap Coefficient (φ)"),
           yaxis = list(title = "Confounder-Outcome R²"))
}
```

**User Benefits:**
- Visualize the "landscape" of sample size requirements
- Identify parameter combinations that yield feasible studies
- Understand relative importance of overlap vs. confounding
- Make informed decisions about study design modifications

**Effort:** 1-2 days

---

#### **Enhancement 2: Automated Sensitivity Analysis Tables**

**Priority:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ **SHOULD HAVE**

**Vision:**
Provide researchers with comprehensive tabular sensitivity analyses that can be directly included in grant applications and protocols, demonstrating due diligence in sample size planning.

**What:**
- **Auto-generated tables** showing N across multiple scenarios
- **Base, Optimistic, Pessimistic** scenario planning
- **Exportable to CSV/Excel** for inclusion in protocols

```
Sensitivity Analysis: Sample Size Requirements

Scenario               | Overlap (φ) | R² | VIF  | N Required | % Increase
-----------------------|-------------|-------|------|------------|------------
Optimistic (Best case) | 0.90        | 0.05  | 1.15 | 575        | +15%
Expected (Base case)   | 0.75        | 0.10  | 1.42 | 710        | +42%
Pessimistic (Worst)    | 0.60        | 0.20  | 2.08 | 1,040      | +108%
Very Poor Overlap      | 0.40        | 0.10  | 2.85 | 1,425      | +185%

Notes:
- RCT-based sample size (no adjustment): N = 500
- All scenarios assume ATE weighting
- Consider ATO (overlap weights) if φ < 0.6
```

**Implementation:**
Already partially implemented via `generate_ps_sensitivity_analysis()` function. Enhancement would:
1. Add pre-set scenario templates (optimistic/expected/pessimistic)
2. Create formatted HTML table output
3. Add download button for CSV export
4. Include interpretation guidance for each scenario

**User Benefits:**
- Transparent uncertainty quantification

- Facilitates discussion with collaborators

**Effort:** 1 day

---

#### **Enhancement 3: Pilot Data Upload & φ Estimation**

**Priority:** ⭐⭐⭐ **NICE TO HAVE**

**Vision:**
Allow researchers to upload pilot propensity score data and automatically estimate the overlap coefficient (φ), removing guesswork and improving accuracy.

**What:**
- **File upload widget** accepting CSV with propensity scores and treatment indicator
- **Automatic φ calculation** using Bhattacharyya formula from actual distributions
- **Distribution visualization** showing treated vs. control PS histograms with overlap region highlighted
- **Recommendations** based on observed overlap patterns

**Workflow:**
1. User uploads CSV with columns: `ps_score`, `treatment` (0/1)
2. Tool fits Beta distributions to each group's PS scores
3. Calculates φ using `calculate_bhattacharyya_coefficient()`
4. Displays: "Based on your pilot data, estimated overlap φ = 0.68 (Fair)"
5. Auto-populates φ slider with estimated value
6. Shows visualization of actual vs. fitted distributions

**Technical Approach:**
```r
# Fit Beta distributions to observed PS data
fit_beta_to_ps <- function(ps_scores) {
  library(fitdistrplus)
  # Transform PS to (0,1) if needed
  ps_01 <- pmax(pmin(ps_scores, 0.999), 0.001)
  # Fit Beta distribution
  fit <- fitdist(ps_01, "beta", method = "mle")
  return(list(a = fit$estimate[1], b = fit$estimate[2]))
}

# Process uploaded pilot data
process_pilot_data <- function(uploaded_file) {
  data <- read.csv(uploaded_file)

  # Split by treatment
  ps_treated <- data$ps_score[data$treatment == 1]
  ps_control <- data$ps_score[data$treatment == 0]

  # Fit distributions
  params_t <- fit_beta_to_ps(ps_treated)
  params_c <- fit_beta_to_ps(ps_control)

  # Calculate φ
  phi <- calculate_bhattacharyya_coefficient(params_t, params_c)

  return(list(phi = phi, params_treated = params_t, params_control = params_c))
}
```

**User Benefits:**
- **Evidence-based φ estimates** from actual data
- Removes subjective guessing
- Provides visual confirmation of overlap quality
- Increases confidence in sample size calculations

**Challenges:**
- Requires pilot data (not always available)
- Assumes pilot data representative of full study
- Beta distribution may not always fit well

**Effort:** 2-3 days

---

#### **Enhancement 4: Literature-Based R² Repository**

**Priority:** ⭐⭐⭐ **NICE TO HAVE**

**Vision:**
Create a built-in database of published confounder-outcome R² values from the literature, allowing researchers to use evidence-based estimates when planning studies in similar domains.

**What:**
- **Searchable database** of R² values by:
  - Clinical domain (cardiology, oncology, psychiatry, etc.)
  - Outcome type (mortality, hospitalization, disease progression, etc.)
  - Confounder set (demographics only, + comorbidities, + biomarkers, etc.)
- **Quick-fill buttons** to populate R² from relevant studies
- **Citation information** for each R² estimate
- **User-contributed entries** (with review process)

**Sample Database Structure:**
```r
rho_squared_database <- list(
  cardiology = list(
    mortality = list(
      demographics_only = list(
        r_squared = 0.08,
        reference = "Smith et al. (2023) JAMA Cardiol",
        sample_size = 15420,
        confounders = "Age, sex, race"
      ),
      demographics_comorbidities = list(
        r_squared = 0.18,
        reference = "Jones et al. (2024) Circulation",
        sample_size = 8932,
        confounders = "Age, sex, race, diabetes, hypertension, prior MI"
      )
    ),
    hospitalization = list(...)
  ),
  oncology = list(...),
  ...
)
```

**UI Implementation:**
```r
# Dropdown selector in UI
selectInput("rho_domain", "Clinical Domain:",
            choices = c("Cardiology", "Oncology", "Psychiatry", ...))

selectInput("rho_outcome", "Outcome Type:",
            choices = c("Mortality", "Hospitalization", "Disease Progression"))

selectInput("rho_confounders", "Confounder Set:",
            choices = c("Demographics only",
                       "Demographics + Comorbidities",
                       "Demographics + Comorbidities + Biomarkers"))

# Quick-fill button
actionButton("use_literature_rho", "Use Literature R²",
             icon = icon("book"))

# Display selected reference
textOutput("rho_reference_citation")
```

**User Benefits:**
- **Evidence-based R² selection** instead of arbitrary guessing
- Supports transparent sample size justification
- Educational: See how confounding varies across domains
- Standardization across research teams

**Challenges:**
- Requires curating literature (time-intensive)
- R² values context-dependent (may not generalize)
- Needs regular updates as new studies publish
- Quality control for user contributions

**Effort:** 1-2 weeks initial curation + ongoing maintenance

---

#### **Enhancement 5: Method Comparison Report Generator**

**Priority:** ⭐⭐⭐ **NICE TO HAVE**

**Vision:**

**What:**
- **One-click PDF generation** via rmarkdown
- **Side-by-side comparison table** of both methods
- **Explanation text** describing why estimates differ
- **Recommendations section** for choosing between methods
- **Publication-ready formatting**

**Report Structure:**
```markdown
# Propensity Score Sample Size Comparison Report

## Study Design Summary
- RCT-based sample size: 500
- Treatment prevalence: 30%
- Weighting method: ATE (Average Treatment Effect)
- Desired power: 80% (α = 0.05)

## Method 1: Austin (2021) VIF Approach

### Inputs
- Anticipated c-statistic: 0.72 (Good discrimination)

### Results
- Variance Inflation Factor: 1.65
- Adjusted sample size: 825 participants
- Increase over RCT: +65% (+325 participants)
- Effective N after weighting: ~500

### Method Basis
Austin (2021) VIF estimation based on empirical relationships between
c-statistic, treatment prevalence, and weighting method.

## Method 2: Li et al. (2025) Overlap + Confounding

### Inputs
- Overlap coefficient (φ): 0.68 (Fair overlap)
- Confounder-outcome R²: 0.14 (Strong confounding)

### Results
- Variance Inflation Factor: 2.18
- Adjusted sample size: 1,090 participants
- Increase over RCT: +118% (+590 participants)
- Effective N after weighting: ~500

### Method Basis
Li et al. (2025) method explicitly accounts for both overlap quality
and confounder-outcome association strength, providing more accurate
estimates when confounding is strong.

## Comparison & Recommendation

| Metric | Austin (2021) | Li et al. (2025) | Difference |
|--------|---------------|------------------|------------|
| VIF    | 1.65          | 2.18             | +32%       |
| N      | 825           | 1,090            | +265       |

**Why do estimates differ?**
Li et al. (2025) accounts for confounder-outcome association (R²=0.14),
which Austin's VIF method does not capture. With moderate confounding,
Li's method requires ~32% more participants than Austin's estimate.

**Recommendation:**
Given the anticipated moderate overlap (φ=0.68) and strong confounding
(R²=0.14), we recommend using the Li et al. (2025) estimate of N=1,090
to ensure adequate power. The Austin estimate may underestimate required
sample size in this scenario.

**Sensitivity Analysis:**
See attached table varying φ (0.5-0.9) and R² (0.05-0.25) to understand
robustness of sample size to parameter uncertainty.
```

**Implementation:**
```r
# Server-side PDF generation
output$download_comparison_report <- downloadHandler(
  filename = function() {
    paste0("PS_Sample_Size_Comparison_", Sys.Date(), ".pdf")
  },
  content = function(file) {
    # Prepare data
    params <- list(
      n_rct = input$vif_n_rct,
      prevalence = input$vif_prevalence,
      austin_results = austin_results,
      li_results = li_results,
      ...
    )

    # Render R Markdown report
    rmarkdown::render(
      "reports/ps_comparison_template.Rmd",
      output_file = file,
      params = params,
      envir = new.env(parent = globalenv())
    )
  }
)
```

**User Benefits:**
- **Professional documentation** for protocols/SAPs
- **Transparent methodology** showing both approaches
- **Supports regulatory submissions** (FDA/EMA)
- **Educational** for stakeholders unfamiliar with PS methods

**Effort:** 2-3 days (including template creation)

#### **Enhancement 6: Real-Time Parameter Guidance**

**Priority:** ⭐⭐ **NICE TO HAVE**

**Vision:**
Provide intelligent, context-aware guidance as users adjust parameters, helping them make informed choices about overlap and confounding assumptions.

**What:**
- **Dynamic help text** that updates based on current parameter values
- **Warning alerts** when parameter combinations suggest infeasibility
- **Recommendation engine** suggesting alternative weighting methods
- **Literature links** to relevant methodological papers

**Examples:**
```r
# When user sets φ = 0.45 (poor overlap)
showNotification(
  "⚠️ Poor overlap detected (φ=0.45). Consider:",
  "• Using overlap weights (ATO) instead of ATE",
  "• Restricting analysis to overlap region",
  "• Collecting more data to improve balance",
  type = "warning",
  duration = NULL
)

# When user sets R² = 0.30 (very strong confounding)
showNotification(
  "⚠️ Very strong confounding (R²=0.30) detected:",
  "• Sample size will be >3× RCT equivalent",
  "• Consider if all important confounders can be measured",
  "• Sensitivity analysis for unmeasured confounding recommended",
  type = "warning",
  duration = NULL
)

# When VIF > 3.0
show_modal_dialog(
  title = "Sample Size May Not Be Feasible",
  content = paste0(
    "The calculated VIF of ", round(vif, 2), " suggests severe ",
    "efficiency loss. Propensity score weighting may not be appropriate.",
    "\n\nConsider alternative methods:",
    "\n• 1:1 Matching (lower variance but smaller N)",
    "\n• Stratification by PS quintiles",
    "\n• Regression adjustment with PS covariate",
    "\n• Instrumental variable analysis (if available)"
  )
)
```

**Inputs:**
- Sample size for complete data
- Expected missingness (%)
- Number of imputations planned (m)
- Expected R² of imputation model

**Outputs:**
- Required sample size with MI
- Efficiency relative to complete-case (usually better)

  - c': Direct effect
- Indirect effect = a × b
- Desired power for indirect effect test

**Outputs:**
- Power for indirect effect (Sobel test or bootstrap)
- Required sample size for 80% power
- Comparison: power for direct vs. indirect effects
- Monte Carlo simulation option for complex models

**Why Missing:** Not in any tier of current roadmap, but increasingly required for grants

**Inputs:**
- Margin (HR scale or absolute time difference)
- Expected HR or RMST difference
- Accrual period
- Follow-up duration
- Event probability
- Non-inferiority or equivalence test type

**Outputs:**
- Required events (primary)
