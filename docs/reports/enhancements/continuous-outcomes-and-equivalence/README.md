# Continuous Outcomes and Equivalence - Enhancement Report

This directory contains documentation for enhancements that extend the tool beyond binary outcomes to support continuous endpoints and non-inferiority designs.

## Files

- **enhancements.md** - Comprehensive summary of continuous outcomes and equivalence implementation
  - Continuous outcomes (t-tests)
  - Non-inferiority testing
  - Enhanced documentation and help systems
  - Example/reset functionality
  - CSV export support

## Features Overview

### 1. Continuous Outcomes (t-tests)

**New Tabs:**
- **Power (Continuous)** - Calculate statistical power for two-group comparisons with continuous endpoints
- **Sample Size (Continuous)** - Calculate required sample size for continuous outcome studies

**Features:**
- Cohen's d effect size support (Small=0.2, Medium=0.5, Large=0.8)
- Unequal sample sizes (allocation ratios)
- Two-sided and one-sided tests
- Adjustable significance levels

**Use Cases:**
- BMI comparisons, blood pressure changes
- Lab values (HbA1c, cholesterol, liver enzymes)
- Quality of life scores (SF-36, EQ-5D)
- Biomarker levels, cognitive function tests

### 2. Non-Inferiority Testing

**New Tab:**
- **Non-Inferiority** - Sample size calculations for non-inferiority trials

**Features:**
- Non-inferiority margin specification
- Regulatory-compliant α=0.025 (one-sided) default
- Allocation ratio support
- Detailed interpretation of results

**Regulatory Context:**
- Generic drug approval studies
- Biosimilar trials
- FDA/EMA pre-specified margin requirements

### 3. Enhanced Documentation

- Comprehensive accordion help panels for all new methods
- Use case examples from RWE research
- Cohen's d interpretation guide
- Regulatory context and margin selection guidance
- Real-world examples (HbA1c comparisons, generic vs. branded drugs)

## Status

✅ **100% Complete** - All continuous outcomes and equivalence requirements successfully implemented

**Coverage:**
- Binary outcomes ✅
- Continuous outcomes ✅
- Survival analysis ✅
- Non-inferiority designs ✅
- **~90% of common RWE study designs now supported**

## Technical Details

**Dependencies:** Uses existing `pwr` package (no new dependencies)

**New R Functions Used:**
- `pwr::pwr.t.test()` - Two-sample t-test (equal n)
- `pwr::pwr.t2n.test()` - Two-sample t-test (unequal n)
- `pwr::ES.h()` - Effect size for proportions
- `pwr::pwr.2p.test()` - Two-proportion test

## Backward Compatibility

✅ All 7 original tabs unchanged
✅ No breaking changes
✅ All existing workflows continue to function identically
