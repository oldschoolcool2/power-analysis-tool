## Features Overview

### Feature 1: Missing Data Adjustment
Inflate sample sizes to account for expected missingness (MCAR, MAR, MNAR mechanisms). Implemented across all 6 sample size calculation tabs.

### Feature 2: Minimal Detectable Effect Size Calculator
Reverse power analysis - calculate what effects can be detected given a fixed sample size. Critical for RWE studies with predetermined database sizes.

### Feature 3: Interactive Power Curves
Replace static base R plots with interactive Plotly visualizations showing power vs. sample size with hover tooltips, zoom, and pan capabilities.

### Feature 4: Variance Inflation Factor Calculator
PSWeight-based VIF calculations for propensity score methods (ATE, ATT, ATO, ATM).
