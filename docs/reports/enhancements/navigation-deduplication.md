# Navigation Deduplication & Contextual Help Implementation

**Date:** October 25, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Completed  
**Issue:** Duplicate navigation mechanisms (sidebar + accordion)

---

## Problem Identified

The application had **two competing navigation mechanisms**:

1. **Left Sidebar Navigation** (✅ Modern, hierarchical)
   - Single Proportion → Power Analysis / Sample Size
   - Two-Group Comparisons → Power Analysis / Sample Size
   - Survival Analysis, Matched Case-Control, etc.

2. **"About this tool" Accordion** (❌ Duplicate, outdated)
   - Listed all the same analysis types again
   - Created confusion and redundancy
   - Not aligned with the UI/UX modernization plan

This violated the modernization plan's principle of having a **single source of truth** for navigation.

---

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Contextual Help System

**New File:** `R/help_content.R`

Created a modular help system with two functions:

#### `create_contextual_help(analysis_type)`
Generates analysis-specific help accordions with:
- **About this Analysis** - Methodology and explanation
- **Use Cases** - Practical applications
- **References** - Academic citations and resources
- **Additional panels** - Context-specific information (e.g., effect measures, matching ratios)

Supports all analysis types:
- `"single_proportion"` - Rule of Three methodology
- `"two_group"` - Comparative studies
- `"survival"` - Cox regression / time-to-event
- `"matched"` - Matched case-control studies
- `"continuous"` - t-tests for continuous outcomes
- `"noninferiority"` - Non-inferiority trials

#### `create_global_help()`
Generates global help content for the Help modal:
- **Regulatory Guidance & References** - FDA/EMA guidance on RWE
- **Interpretation Guide** - Understanding power, alpha, effect sizes

### 2. Removed Duplicate Accordion

**Modified:** `app.R` (lines 534-586)

**Removed:**
```r
# OLD: Global accordion with all analysis types
h1("About this tool"),
accordion(
  accordion_panel(title = "Single Proportion Analysis (Rule of Three)", ...),
  accordion_panel(title = "Two-Group Comparisons", ...),
  # ... all analysis types listed
)
```

**Added:**
```r
# NEW: Contextual help panels that appear based on sidebar selection
conditionalPanel(
  condition = "input.sidebar_page == 'power_single' || input.sidebar_page == 'ss_single'",
  div(class = "content-card help-section",
    create_contextual_help("single_proportion")
  )
),
# ... similar panels for each analysis type
```

### 3. Enhanced Help Button

**Modified:** `R/header_ui.R`

**Changed:**
```r
# OLD: Placeholder alert
onclick = "alert('Help documentation coming soon!')"

# NEW: Proper action button triggering modal
actionButton("show_help_modal", ...)
```

### 4. Added Global Help Modal

**Modified:** `app.R` (lines 90-112)

Added a Bootstrap modal (via `shinyBS::bsModal`) that:
- Is triggered by the Help button in the header
- Contains an introduction to the tool
- Displays regulatory guidance and interpretation guides
- Uses large modal size for better readability

### 5. Styled Help Sections

**Modified:** `www/css/modern-theme.css`

Added CSS for:
- `.help-section` - Contextual help styling
- `.modal-header-title` - Modal header with icon
- `.modal-intro` - Highlighted introduction panel in modal
- Subtle accordion styling for help content

## Benefits

### ✅ Eliminates Confusion
- **One navigation system:** Sidebar only
- **Clear hierarchy:** Analysis type → Power/Sample Size
- **No duplicate listings** of the same content

### ✅ Improves Context
- Help content is **relevant to what you're viewing**
- No need to scroll through unrelated analysis types
- Focused, targeted guidance

### ✅ Follows Modernization Plan
- Aligns with Phase 2 (Navigation Redesign) of UI/UX plan
- Implements Phase 5 (Content Presentation - Clean Accordions)
- Single source of truth for navigation

### ✅ Better UX
- **Contextual help** appears after calculation
- **Global help** available via header button
- **Less scrolling** - relevant content only
- **Cleaner interface** - reduced visual clutter

### ✅ Maintainability
- Modular help content in dedicated file
- Easy to update individual analysis help
- Separation of concerns (navigation vs. help vs. content)

## User Experience Flow

### Before
1. User sees sidebar navigation
2. User scrolls down past Calculate button
3. User encounters **duplicate** accordion with all analysis types again
4. Confusion: "Which one do I use?"

### After
1. User sees sidebar navigation (single source of truth)
2. User selects analysis type from sidebar
3. User enters parameters and clicks Calculate
4. **Contextual help** for that specific analysis appears below results
5. User can click **Help button** in header for global guidance

   - Global help generator function

2. **`R/header_ui.R`**
   - Updated Help button to trigger modal

3. **`app.R`**
   - Sourced `help_content.R`
   - Removed global "About this tool" accordion (lines 538-642 → 538-586)
   - Added contextual help conditionalPanels
   - Added global help modal

4. **`www/css/modern-theme.css`**
   - Added help section styling
   - Added modal styling

## Next Steps

### Recommended
1. **User testing** - Verify improved navigation clarity
2. **Content review** - Ensure all help text is accurate and up-to-date
3. **Accessibility audit** - Test keyboard navigation and screen readers
4. **Add keyboard shortcut** - e.g., `?` key to open help modal

### Future Enhancements
1. **Search functionality** in help modal
2. **Video tutorials** embedded in contextual help
3. **Interactive examples** that pre-fill parameters
4. **Contextual tooltips** that reference help sections
5. **Print-friendly help** documentation

## Implementation Notes

### Why Contextual Instead of Global?

The modernization plan (Phase 3.1) specified:

> ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────┐
> │ HELP & METHODOLOGY (accordion)               │
> │                                              │
> │ ▼ About this Analysis  ← CONTEXTUAL         │
> │   [Expanded content]                         │
> │ ▶ Use Cases                                  │
> │ ▶ References                                 │
> └──────────────────────────────────────────────┘

This approach:
- Reduces cognitive load (only show relevant info)
- Improves information scent (help is where you need it)
- Follows progressive disclosure principle
- Aligns with modern SPA design patterns

### Why Keep Global Help in Modal?

Some content is **universally applicable**:
- Regulatory guidance (FDA/EMA) applies to all analyses
- Interpretation guide (power, alpha) is fundamental
- Statistical references are cross-cutting

A modal provides:
- Quick access from any page via header
- Doesn't clutter the main workflow
- Can be dismissed easily
- Better for reference material
