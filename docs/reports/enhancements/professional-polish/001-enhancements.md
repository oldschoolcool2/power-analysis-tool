# Tier 3 Enhancements - Professional Polish

## Summary
This release implements comprehensive UI/UX improvements, educational resources, and infrastructure updates to transform the power analysis tool into a professional, production-ready application suitable for pharmaceutical RWE research and regulatory submissions.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Modern UI/UX Design ✅

#### bslib Theme Integration

#### Example Buttons (All 7 Tabs)
Pre-filled scenarios with realistic pharmaceutical RWE values:
- **Power (Single)**: Rare adverse event study (n=1500, 1 in 500 event rate)
