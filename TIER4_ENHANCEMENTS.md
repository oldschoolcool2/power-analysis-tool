# Tier 4 Enhancements - Advanced Statistical Methods

## Summary
This release implements advanced statistical methods to extend the power analysis tool beyond binary outcomes, adding support for continuous endpoints and non-inferiority designs commonly used in pharmaceutical RWE research and generic/biosimilar approval studies.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Continuous Outcomes (t-tests) ✅

#### New Tab: Power (Continuous)
Calculate statistical power for two-group comparisons with continuous endpoints using two-sample t-tests.

**Features:**
- Supports unequal sample sizes (n1 ≠ n2)
- Cohen's d effect size input with interpretation guidance (Small=0.2, Medium=0.5, Large=0.8)
- Two-sided and one-sided tests (greater, less)
- Adjustable significance level (α)

**Use Cases:**
- BMI comparisons between treatment groups
- Blood pressure changes (systolic, diastolic)
- Lab values: HbA1c, cholesterol, liver enzymes
- Quality of life scores (SF-36, EQ-5D)
- Cognitive function tests
- Biomarker levels

**Statistical Method:**
- Two-sample t-test for independent groups
- Effect size: Cohen's d = (μ1 - μ2) / σ_pooled
- R function: `pwr::pwr.t2n.test()`

**Example Scenario:**
Comparing mean HbA1c reduction between two diabetes medications:
- Group 1 (new drug): n=150
- Group 2 (standard care): n=150
- Expected effect size: d=0.5 (moderate effect)
- Result: 81.8% power at α=0.05 (two-sided)

#### New Tab: Sample Size (Continuous)
Calculate required sample size per group to detect a specified effect size in continuous outcomes.

**Features:**
- Allocation ratio support (unequal group sizes)
- Handles Cohen's d from 0.01 to 5.0
- Iterative calculation for unequal allocation
- Two-sided and one-sided alternatives

**Statistical Method:**
- For equal n: `pwr::pwr.t.test(type = "two.sample")`
- For unequal n: Iterative root-finding with `pwr::pwr.t2n.test()`

**Example Scenario:**
Designing a study to detect medium effect (d=0.4) with 90% power:
- Desired power: 90%
- Effect size: Cohen's d = 0.4
- α = 0.05 (two-sided)
- Result: n1=132, n2=132, Total N=264

---

### 2. Non-Inferiority Testing ✅

#### New Tab: Non-Inferiority
Sample size calculations for non-inferiority trials where the goal is to demonstrate a new treatment is "not worse" than a reference treatment by more than a pre-specified clinically acceptable margin.

**Features:**
- Non-inferiority margin specification (percentage points)
- Event rates for both test and reference groups
- Allocation ratio support
- One-sided testing at α=0.025 (standard for non-inferiority)
- Detailed interpretation in results

**Regulatory Context:**
- Commonly used for generic drug approval
- Biosimilar studies
- FDA/EMA require pre-specification of margin with clinical justification
- Standard: α=0.025 one-sided (equivalent to two-sided α=0.05)

**Statistical Method:**
- H0: p_test - p_reference ≥ margin (inferior)
- H1: p_test - p_reference < margin (non-inferior)
- Effect size: `ES.h(p1, p2 + margin)`
- R function: `pwr::pwr.2p.test(alternative = "less")`

**Example Scenario:**
Generic formulation vs. branded drug for adverse events:
- Test group (generic): 12% event rate
- Reference group (branded): 10% event rate
- Non-inferiority margin: 4 percentage points
- Desired power: 85%
- α = 0.025 (one-sided)
- Result: n1=456, n2=456, Total N=912

**Interpretation:**
Non-inferiority is demonstrated if the upper bound of the 95% CI for (Test - Reference) is less than the margin (4%). In this example, if the difference is ≤4 percentage points, the generic is considered non-inferior to the branded drug.

- Reset: Returns to 80% power, 10% vs 10%, 5% margin

---

### 5. Input Validation ✅

Cohen's d represents the difference in means divided by the pooled standard deviation."

- **No new dependencies required**

### R Functions Used
- `pwr::pwr.t.test()` - Two-sample t-test (equal n)
- `pwr::pwr.t2n.test()` - Two-sample t-test (unequal n)
- `pwr::ES.h()` - Effect size calculation for proportions
- `pwr::pwr.2p.test()` - Two-proportion test
- `pwr::pwr.2p2n.test()` - Two-proportion test (unequal n)
- `uniroot()` - Root finding for unequal allocation

### Calculations

**Cohen's d (Continuous Outcomes):**
```r
d = (mean_1 - mean_2) / sqrt((sd_1^2 + sd_2^2) / 2)
```

**Non-Inferiority Effect Size:**
```r
# Test against margin, not zero
h = ES.h(p_test, p_reference + margin)
# One-sided test: H1: p_test - p_reference < margin
```
