#' Calculate Bhattacharyya Coefficient for Overlap
#'
#' Measures the overlap between treatment and control propensity score distributions.
#' The Bhattacharyya coefficient quantifies distributional overlap.
#'
#' @param treatment_prop Proportion of subjects receiving treatment (0-1)
#' @param ps_params_treated Parameters for Beta distribution of PS in treated (list with a, b)
#' @param ps_params_control Parameters for Beta distribution of PS in control (list with a, b)
#' @return Bhattacharyya coefficient (0-1), where 1 = perfect overlap, 0 = no overlap
#'
#' @details
#' For Beta-distributed propensity scores, the Bhattacharyya coefficient is:
#' φ = [Γ(a+0.5)/(a^(1/2)Γ(a))] × [Γ(b+0.5)/(b^(1/2)Γ(b))]
